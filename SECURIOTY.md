# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please email **cristiano@theatlasos.com** with:
- Repository and version (tag/commit SHA)
- Technical details + Proof of Concept
- Impact assessment and potential mitigations
- Your contact for follow-up

Subject line: **[SECURITY] <short summary>**
We accept reports in English or Portuguese.

## Our Commitment
- **Acknowledgement:** within 72 hours
- **Triage & reproduction:** within 7 days
- **Fix timeline:** severity-based; we aim to ship patches quickly and coordinate disclosure
- **Coordinated disclosure window:** 90 days by default (can be shorter/longer by mutual agreement)

## Scope
- This GitHub organization and its repositories:
- `aos-decision-trace-schema`
- `aos-evidence-export-packs`
- `aos-policygates-checklist`
- Third-party services and dependencies are out of scope, but we’ll coordinate when relevant.

## Safe Harbor
We will not pursue or support legal action for good-faith, non-destructive research that:
- Avoids privacy violations (no PII exfiltration)
- Does not degrade or deny service
- Respects applicable laws and only uses your own accounts/data

## Credit & Bounties
We don’t run a bounty program yet. With permission, we will **credit reporters** in release notes.

Thank you for helping keep the ecosystem safe.
